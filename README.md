The Project 'REDBUS DATASCRAPING USING SELENIUM AND DYNAMIC FILTERING USING STREAMLIT' aims at Automating the Bus searching task easier and time saving.
This project involves scraping data from the Redbus website using Selenium, 
Storing the scraped data in a MySQL database, and 
Developing a Streamlit application to dynamically filter and display the data. The goal is to automate the data extraction process and provide a user-friendly interface for data exploration.

Tools and Technologies:
Python: For scripting and data manipulation.
Selenium: For web scraping.
MySQL: For data storage.
Streamlit: For creating the web application.
Jupyter Notebook: For development and testing.
Visual studio :  For development and testing.(streamlit)

The Process involves Scrapping  the bus details for 10 states or above.the extraction is done on route links,route names,Bus name, start time,end time,duration,Seat availability and star ratings. this is done using Selenium in which the code is written in python language.
The Scrapped data is then stored in Mysql db using pymysql for connection. The db is connected to the app that is  built using streamlit which uses dynamic filters.
The filtering is done using Sql queries in  the streamlit app. The bus data is then filtered and displayed to the users based on the input.
